                Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white
                pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small,
                pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws.
                On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two
                slender, tentacle-like vines and provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds
                contained within.Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white
